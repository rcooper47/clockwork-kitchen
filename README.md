# Clockwork Kitchen


A game for MomoCon's Peach Jam 2024


### How to Play

You have one minute to fulfill orders in the Clockwork Kitchen! Food will fall from the top of the screen. Catch ingredients on the plates to send them forward or backward in time and turn them into other foods. Collect ingredients on the right plates to fill as many orders as you can! Use WASD to move the rewind plate and arrow keys to move the fast forward plate.
